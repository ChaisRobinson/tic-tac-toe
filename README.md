# Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Retro 8-bit style with custom font and colors
- Game status display (current player's turn, winner, or draw)

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game will start with Player X's turn.
3. Click on an empty cell to place your mark (X or O).
4. The game will alternate between players X and O.
5. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
6. If all cells are filled, and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
7. Click the "Restart" button to play again.
